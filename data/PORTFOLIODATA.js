Buyers could choose to orient the runways on their wall in any fashion they desired. These ideas led notNeutral to explore a product brand based on the concept of travel."],

Objectives included contending with overly ambitious ground-floor retail requirements, which were resulting in an abundance of vacant storefronts, largely due to the exploding residential market of the early 2000s. I made revisions to allow more flexibility for ground-floor uses, while also creating new development standards and revising design guidelines to help ensure buildings would be designed in ways that encourage pedestrian activity and placemaking. I also made recommendations that limited surface parking lots and aggressively lowered parking requirements in places near transit. The recommendations were unanimously adopted by City Council."],

After the units were constructed, I conducted an analysis, surveys and outreach efforts to guage the level of acceptance for the idea of &ldquo;backyard cottages&rdquo; in Seattle's single family neighborhoods. These small housing units now provide an important housing option in the city's most expansive zoning district. "],
