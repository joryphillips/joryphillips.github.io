      <p>I build things that make people's lives easier and better.
        I have designed & developed apps for Google, helped a branding agency
        brand itself, and created design guidelines and illustrations for major
        cities and a movie studio/theme park. I've led teams that make
        complicated stuff, and I am often eager to attempt the impossible.</p>
        <p>Want to collaborate?
