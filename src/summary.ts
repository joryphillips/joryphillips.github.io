      <p>My strength is bridging big-picture concepts with detailed implementation. I am especially interested in projects that
        help people navigate and understand complex things.</p>
      <p>I have designed & developed apps for Google, helped a branding agency brand itself, and created design guidelines and
        illustrations for major cities and a movie studio/theme park. I have also delivered scores of presentations to decision
        makers, community groups, and professional organizations. I can prototype, design, develop, or present your ideas
        and information with interest, interaction, and positive experiences.</p>
