					<img src="images/shanghai-full-width-section-trnsp.png" alt="shanghai-full-width-section-trnsp">
					<p>As part of a competition to master plan a portion of a new theme park and entertainment destination in Shanghai, I digitally painted section and elevations line drawings to convey exiting, active retail, restaurant, and entertainment areas. Drawing from a variety of textures and patterns found in design and fashion magazines, I experimented with transparency, overlap, and varying hues to reach an appropriate balance.</p>

					<h3>Conceptual Product Design</h3>
					<img id="notneutral" src="images/heathrow-final.png" alt="heathrow-final"><br>
					<img src="images/runway-clocks.svg">
					<p>Tasked with coming up with product ideas that could build upon <a href="http://www.notneutral.com/" target="_blank">notNeutral</a>'s successful CityPlates, I started analyzing aerial photographs of different cities for inspiration. I was especially drawn to the way airports look from above. The top graphic was presented as an idea for a wall graphic or clock, with the runways as moving hands that align properly at 1:45.</p>
					<p>The second graphic is intended to be a large-scale wall graphic of two runways that also functions as a digital clock, with the numbers at the ends of the runways denoting hours and minutes. Buyers could choose to orient the runways on their wall in any fashion they desired. These ideas led notNeutral to explore a product brand based on the concept of travel.</p>

					<h3>Photo Simulations</h3>
					<img id="viewsim" src="images/viewsim.jpg">
					
					<p>For the Universal Studios Master Plan, I led the production of a dozen or more photo simulations for the project’s environmental review, to demonstrate that the project would not adversely impact views. These simulations, including the above example, were produced using SketchUp with a rendering plug-in and Photoshop.</p>

					<p>I coordinated the production and ongoing revision of this 3D model among a team of designers, which was used in photo simulations and in site design to find the right dispersion and maximum heights of proposed residential buildings on the site. I also modeled several buildings myself, along with conceptual landscape design.</p>

					<h3>Santa Monica Zoning Ordinance &amp; Design Guidelines</h3>
					<img id="smdg" src="images/smdg.png">
					
					<p>I recently directed the production of new Zoning Ordinance and Design Guidelines to be used in the decision-making process for new multifamily, commercial, and mixed-use development in Santa Monica. These efforts will help make Santa Monica more pedestrian, bicycle, and transit-friendly, improve the quality of new development, and make the zoning ordinance itself more legible and accessible.

					<h3>Seattle Multifamily Housing Presentation</h3>
					<img src="images/seattle-mf-crop.png">
					
					<p>I conducted an analysis of Seattle's multifamily-zoned areas and created a series of presentation boards for use in a public meetings to discuss how they might change over time. These materials ultimately led to the comprehensive revision of Seattle's multifamily zoning districts.</p>

					<h3>Universal Studios Master Plan</h3>
					<img id="USMP" src="images/usmp.png">
					
					<p>While working at Rios Clementi Hale Studios, I managed a multidisciplinary team of designers to help Universal Studios create an 'entitlement package' that adopted their new master plan. Their needs constantly shifted, and included maintaining a building inventory, creating view simulations, 3D modeling, mapping, diagramming, and preparing various presentation materials.</p>

					<h3>Seattle Neighborhood Business District Strategy</h3>
					<img src="images/nbds-bird.jpg">
					
					<p>While at the City of Seattle, I managed a project to revise its commercial and mixed-use zoning and design guidelines. Objectives included contending with overly ambitious ground-floor retail requirements, which were resulting in an abundance of vacant storefronts, largely due to the exploding residential market of the early 2000s. I made revisions to allow more flexibility for ground-floor uses, while also creating new development standards and revising design guidelines to help ensure buildings would be designed in ways that encourage pedestrian activity and placemaking. I also made recommendations that limited surface parking lots and aggressively lowered parking requirements in places near transit. The recommendations were unanimously adopted by City Council.</p>

					<h3>Seattle Backyard Cottages</h3>
					<img id="ADUs" src="images/dadu-sketch.png">
					
					<p>I managed a project to examine allowing cottages and detached second units in single-family zones, which comprises most of the land of the city. I administered a demonstration program that allowed a few examples of cottages and second units to be built under tight constraints related to neighbor acceptance and a design selection committee. After the units were constructed, I conducted an analysis, surveys and outreach efforts to guage the level of acceptance for the idea of &ldquo;backyard cottages&rdquo; in Seattle's single family neighborhoods. These small housing units now provide an important housing option in the city's most expansive zoning district. </p>
